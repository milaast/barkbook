Data resources: 
    Fake people and pet (cats and dogs) profiles. 

MVP: 
    - User profiles: username, real name, a short description, location (city, zipcode), picture, e-mail.
    - Pet profiles: Picture, name, weight, age, breed.
        Relationship between User and Pet: One User to many Pets. 
    - A button that express interest in the pet and sends the owner a message with the persons email address. 
    - Search feature: simple. By weight, by breed, by zipcode or city (NOT RADIUS). 

Possible API's: 
    - Facebook to log-in and sharing (not MVP).
    - Twitter to share (not MVP).

Future features: 
    - Google Location API (after MVP)
    - Messaging (NOT instant)
    - Users to upload profile picture (Figure out how it is going to work, where it will be store, etc.)


Things to research: 
    - The interest button. Sends a POST request to server. Separate data model. 
    Profile requesting info. ID of pet profile that they express interest in. 
    "Give me records where someone asked about a pet that I own"

    Each table will have unique IDs. 
    User table
    Pet table
    User + Pet table that relates both other tables (user id and pet id to estabilish relation between the two - join table). 
    Pet interest table: Also auto generated ID, user ID (requester), pet ID, user owner ID. Shows owner who is interested in their pet and interested person the pets they are interested in. 

    ID's - Primary key! Auto generated (in all four tables)



Denormalization: makes easier to look things up.
